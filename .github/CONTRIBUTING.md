### Introduction (first timers)

Thank you for your interest in raising an Issue with the Saashq Framework. An Issue could mean a bug report or a request for a missing feature. By raising a bug report, you are contributing to the development of the Saashq Framework and this is the first step of participating in the community. Bug reports are very helpful for developers as they quickly fix the issue before other users start facing it.

Feature requests are also a great way to take the product forward. New ideas can come in any user scenario and the issue list also acts a roadmap of future features.

When you are raising an Issue, you should keep a few things in mind. Remember that the developer does not have access to your machine so you must give all the information you can while raising an Issue. If you are suggesting a feature, you should be very clear about what you want.

The Issue list is not the right place to ask a question or start a general discussion. If you want to do that , then the right place is the forum ~~<https://discuss.saashq.org>~~ => [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/saashq) tagged under `saashq`.

### Reply and Closing Policy

If your issue is not clear or does not meet the guidelines, then it will be closed. If it is closed, please supply the information asked and re-open it.

### General Issue Guidelines

1. **Search existing Issues:** Before raising a Issue, search if it has been raised before. Maybe add a üëç or give additional help by creating a mockup if it is not already created.
2. **Report each issue separately:** Don't club multiple, unrelated issues in one note.
3. **Brief:** Please don't include long explanations. Use screenshots and bullet points instead of descriptive paragraphs.

### Bug Report Guidelines

1. **Steps to Reproduce:** The bug report must have a list of steps needed to reproduce a bug. If we cannot reproduce it, then we cannot solve it.
1. **Version Number:** Please add the version number in your report. Often a bug is fixed in the latest version
1. **Clear Title:** Add a clear subject to your bug report like "Unable to submit Purchase Order without Basic Rate" instead of just "Cannot Submit"
1. **Screenshots:** Screenshots are a great way of communicating the issues. Try adding annotations or using LiceCAP to take a screencast in `gif`.

### Feature Request Guidelines

1. **Clarity:** Clearly specify how do you want the feature to behave. Don't just say "I would like multiple PDF formats", say that "Ability to add multiple print formats for customers with different languages".
1. **Solution:** Try and identify how the feature should look like.
1. **Mockups:** Mockups are a great way to explain your requirement.
