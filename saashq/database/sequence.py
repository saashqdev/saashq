# NOTE:
# FOR MARIADB - using no cache - as during backup, if the sequence was used in anyform,
# it drops the cache and uses the next non cached value in setval query and
# puts that in the backup file, which will start the counter
# from that value when inserting any new record in the doctype.
# By default the cache is 1000 which will mess up the sequence when
# using the system after a restore.
#
# Another case could be if the cached values expire then also there is a chance of
# the cache being skipped.
#
# FOR POSTGRES - The sequence cache for postgres is per connection.
# Since we're opening and closing connections for every request this results in skipping the cache
# to the next non-cached value hence not using cache in postgres.
